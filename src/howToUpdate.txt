THIS IS FROM DANIEL, TO DANIEL:


steps to push an update:

1. do the code changes and commit to master
2. cd to repo directory, and "npm run deploy"
3. once published, go to repo settings on github
4. make sure branch is gh-pages(this should already be set)
5. set custom domain to "binoy.co"
6. change theme to anything(this is weird ik but just do it)
7. give it a minute or two
8. check if it works
9. if not working, figure it out lmao
